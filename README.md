## **About.** 
I have created a website whereby I am promoting myself as a professional photographer. 
My aim with this website was to showcase my abilities as a photographer to potential clients. 
There is a page where people can learn a little about me, and a gallery where people can view 
my most recent images. I have also included a Contact Me page so potential clients can get in 
touch using a contact form. 

# UX (User Experience).
## **Target audience.** 
The target audience for my website is people who are looking for images for personal and 
commercial use such as small businesses for promotional purposes and newspaper articles.
