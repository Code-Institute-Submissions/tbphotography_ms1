# Code Institute Milestone Project 1. 

## Taylor Brookes Photography. 
[Live Website Here!](https://taybro23.github.io/tbphotography_ms1/)

## **About.** 
I have created a website whereby I am promoting myself as a professional photographer. 
My aim with this website was to showcase my abilities as a photographer to potential clients. 
There is a page where people can learn a little about me, and a gallery where people can view 
my most recent images. I have also included a Contact Me page so potential clients can get in 
touch using a contact form. 

# UX (User Experience).
## **Target audience.** 
The target audience for my website is people who are looking for images for personal and 
commercial use such as small businesses for promotional purposes and newspaper articles. 

## **Wireframes.**
The Link to my wireframes is below. I have changed the website layout since doing the wireframes,
however I believe these changes have made the live website look better overall.

# Design.
## **Typography.**
Open Sans Condensed – This is the main font I used for the site due to its simple and clean look.
Bad Script – I wanted something a bit more artistic for the secondary font, and Bad Script fit that for me.
Sans Serif – This is the reserve font should anything go wrong with the previous two. 

## **Colours.**
The main colours for my website are shades of blues and greens that complement the images used throughout 
the site. Black and white colours are kept for the text and alternative backgrounds, and I used a shade of 
pink for the review section to make it stand out. I used different opacities of these colours in order to 
improve the overall look of the site.

Colours used;
* #000 - Black used for the text
* rgb(86, 172, 245) - A shade of blue used mainly for the navbar, as well as the hover colour for the Submit 
button on the Contact Me page.
* rgb(55, 135, 56) - A shade of green used for the footer.
* #fff - White used for social links on the footer and the contact form background colour. 
* #c6ebffa3 - A shade of blue used on the homepage section one.
* #dffbe6ab - A shade of green used on the homepage section two.
* #ade5ff66 - Another shade of blue, used on the About Me page for the background
of the images.
* #ff40d180 - Pink, used for the review section on my About Me page.


## **Imagery.** 
All images used on my website were taken by myself. 



# Features.


# Technologies Used.
## **Languages.**
In this project, I used the following languages;
* HTML
* CSS

## **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used.**
* Boostrap – Bootstrap was used to help me with the basic layouts for the pages, as well as provide 
JavaScript to create a collapsible menu on mobile devices.
* Google Fonts – I used google fonts to find the best two fonts for use on my website. 
* Github – Github was used to store the code for the project
* Chrome Developer Tools – This helped me to make amendments live to the site and check media queries.
* Balsamiq – This was used to create the wireframes


# Testing.


# Credits.
## **Content.** 
* Navbar – I used Bootstrap for the navbar and edited the code to change the style and colour. 
* Social Links – For the social links I followed the code from a tutorial at Code Institute, 
specifically the CV website build. I made small amendments.
* About me – For the circular pictures on the “About Me” page I followed the code from the 
Love Running tutorial at Code Institute.
* Review – The carousel I used for the review section was code from Bootstrap. I made some amendments.
* Bootstrap indicator edit – I used stack overflow to help me with editing the indicators and the 
general look over the carousel. 
* Form – The code I used for the form was a tutorial from Code Institute, used specifically 
on the CV website build. 

## **Acknowledgements.**
I want to thank my mentor Maranatha for helping me to improve my site, and my fellow Code Institue students 
for their assistance in code queries and improvements!
