# Code Institute Milestone Project 1. 

## Taylor Brookes Photography. 
[Live Website Here!](https://taybro23.github.io/tbphotography_ms1/)

## **About.** 
I have created a website whereby I am promoting myself as a professional photographer. 
My aim with this website was to showcase my abilities as a photographer to potential clients. 
There is a page where people can learn a little about me, and a gallery where people can view 
my most recent picures. I have also included a Contact Me page so potential clients can get in 
touch using a contact form. 

# UX (User Experience).
## **Target audience.** 
The target audience for my website is people who are looking for pictures for personal and 
commercial use such as small businesses for promotional purposes and newspaper articles. 

## **User Stories.**
### **Personal Customer Stories**
* A personal customer would want a good looking website with lots of information and examples of work. 
* They will be more interested to learn more about the person, what kind of photo shoots they do and experiences that previous customers have had. 
* They would like to have the information needed to be able to contact the person if they wish to discuss a possible photo shoot.
* Social media may be more important to a personal customer, and they will be able to find these links on the footer of each page. 

### **Commercial Customer Stories**
* For a business owner, they would like to see a simple design that is easy to navigate.
* All the information they needed would be easily accessible. Main information to be provided to the potential client upon arrival of the website, this is on the footer of each page, and in the clearly marked “Contact Me” page. 
* A business customer is less likely to have ample amounts of time to look through sites so all information is put on separate pages so they can go directly to what they are looking for.
* Examples of previous work is important. The gallery page showcases the best/most recent photographs and shows the photographers versatility.


## **Wireframes.**
The Link to my wireframes is below. I have changed the website layout since doing the wireframes,
however I believe these changes have made the live website look better overall.

# Features.

## **Existing Features.**

### **Across All Pages.**

* Navbar
  * The navbar is has been set to "fixed top" so that it will alway be accessible and pages can easily be
navigated between. This improves overall user experience.
* Responsive design
  * My website was built mobile first and is fully responsive. This was done using Bootstrap.
* Hover effects
  * I used hover effects throughout the website to make the site more visually appealing and to 
  help users navigate more easily.
* Colour scheme
  * I used background colours throughout my site to differentiate between sections. This makes it more pleasing to the eye
  and helps to break the view up from a pure white background features on many sites.

### **Home.**
* Large homepage image 
  * The large homepage image welcomes people to the site and lets them get a taste of what to expect throughout 
  the rest of the site. The bright colours and welcoming layout make sure that the user has a great intial 
  response to the design.

### **About Me.**
* Central photo
  * The central photo of myself allows people to see who I am, and it also adds a personal touch to the website.
* Carousel review section
  * For the review section on my website I wanted it to look good and flow well with the rest of the site. 
  I achieved this by implimenting a carousel. Users are able to easily flick between reviews without being 
  bombarded with paragraphs and paragraphs of text at one time. 

### **Gallery.**
* Area breakdown
  * Gallery is broken down into areas where photos were taken. This allows the user to see my versatility as a photographer
and get an idea of what they can expect from me.

### **Contact Me.**
* Large background cover image 
  * A large background image behind the form works well as it avoids any blank space behind or around the form.
  The contact form itself is slightly transparent to help it blend in.


# Design.
## **Typography.**
* Open Sans Condensed – This is the main font I used for the site due to its simple and clean look.
* Bad Script – I wanted something a bit more artistic for the secondary font, and Bad Script fit that for me.
* Sans Serif – This is the reserve font should anything go wrong with the previous two. 

## **Colours.**
The main colours for my website are shades of blues and greens that complement the images used throughout 
the site. Black and white colours are kept for the text and alternative backgrounds, and I used a shade of 
pink for the review section to make it stand out. I used different opacities of these colours in order to 
improve the overall look of the site.

List of colours used;
* #000 - Black used for the text
* rgb(86, 172, 245) - A shade of blue used mainly for the navbar, as well as the hover colour for the Submit 
button on the Contact Me page.
* rgb(55, 135, 56) - A shade of green used for the footer.
* #fff - White used for social links on the footer and the contact form background colour. 
* #c6ebffa3 - A shade of blue used on the homepage section one.
* #dffbe6ab - A shade of green used on the homepage section two.
* #ade5ff66 - Another shade of blue, used on the About Me page for the background
of the images.
* #ff40d180 - Pink, used for the review section on my About Me page.

## **Imagery.** 
All photos used on my website are photos taken by myself. 


# Technologies Used.
## **Languages.**
In this project, I used the following languages;
* HTML
* CSS

## **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used.**
* Boostrap – Bootstrap was used to help me with the basic layouts for the pages, as well as providing 
me with JavaScript to create a collapsible menu on mobile devices.
* Google Fonts – I used google fonts to find the best two fonts to suit the needs of my website. 
* Github – Github was used to store the code for the project.
* Chrome Developer Tools – This helped me by allowing me to make amendments live to the site, as well as to check media queries.
* Balsamiq – This was used to create the original wireframes.


# Testing.
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used for HTML validation.
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used for CSS validation.

# Credits.
## **Content.** 
* Navbar – I used Bootstrap for the navbar and edited the code to change the style and colour. 
* Social Links – For the social links I followed the code from a tutorial at Code Institute, 
specifically the CV website build. I made small amendments. I also used icons from Font Awesome.
* About me – For the circular pictures on the “About Me” page I followed the code from the 
Love Running tutorial at Code Institute.
* Review – The carousel I used for the review section was code from Bootstrap. I made some amendments.
* Bootstrap indicator edit – I used stack overflow to help me with editing the indicators and the 
general look over the carousel. 
* Form – The code I used for the form was a tutorial from Code Institute, used specifically 
on the CV website build. 

## **Acknowledgements.**
I want to thank my mentor Maranatha for helping me to improve my site, and my fellow Code Institue students 
for their assistance in code queries and improvements!
