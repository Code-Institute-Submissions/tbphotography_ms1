# Code Institute Milestone Project 1. 

## Taylor Brookes Photography. 
[Live Website Here!](https://taybro23.github.io/tbphotography_ms1/)

## **About.** 
I have created a website whereby I am promoting myself as a professional photographer. 
My aim with this website was to showcase my abilities as a photographer to potential clients. 
There is a page where people can learn a little about me, and a gallery where people can view 
my most recent images. I have also included a Contact Me page so potential clients can get in 
touch using a contact form. 

# UX (User Experience).
## **Target audience.** 
The target audience for my website is people who are looking for images for personal and 
commercial use such as small businesses for promotional purposes and newspaper articles. 

## **Wireframes.**
The Link to my wireframes is below. I have changed the website layout since doing the wireframes,
however I believe these changes have made the live website look better overall.

# Design.
## **Typography.**
Open Sans Condensed – This is the main font I used for the site due to its simple and clean look.
Bad Script – I wanted something a bit more artistic for the secondary font, and Bad Script fit that for me.
Sans Serif – This is the reserve font should anything go wrong with the previous two. 

## **Colours.**
The main colours for my website are shades of blues and greens that complement the images used throughout 
the site. Black and white colours are kept for the text and alternative backgrounds, and I used a shade of 
pink for the review section to make it stand out. 



## **Imagery.** 
All images used on my website were taken by myself. 



# Features.

In this project, I used the following languages;

## **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used.**
* Boostrap – Bootstrap was used to help me with the basic layouts for the pages, as well as provide JavaScript to create a collapsible menu on mobile devices.
* Google Fonts – I used google fonts to find the best two fonts for use on my website. 
* Github – Github was used to store the code for the project
* Chrome Developer Tools – This helped me to make amendments live to the site and check media queries.
